# Here it is possible to override the OpenAPI spec as long as it follows the OAS3 specifications.
# Make sure to input the required configurations in .OpenapiConfig.SwaggerUIConfigOverrideFile
# and ensure that .OpenapiConfig.SwaggerUIConfig is configured as well as it only overrides
# the bundled yaml file.
#
# To generate the bundled file, run make swagger-ui-dist in this folder.
